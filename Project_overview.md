## üóÇ Purpose

This file centralizes the **current status**, **pending tasks**, and **architecture overview** for the Harmony Trading Bot project.

It acts as the main project management document to coordinate development efforts, track progress, and guide coding.

## ‚úÖ Completed / Verified (Summary)

- Detailed bot trading strategies for 4 Harmony bots (arbitrage, take profit, dip buys, pool arbitrage)
- Verified contract addresses, pool info, fee tiers
- Database schema for SQLite with comprehensive trade data fields
- Risk controls designed: max slippage (0.3%), gas price cap (150 gwei), cooldown timers
- Coinbase API integration scoped as price oracle only (no trades on Coinbase yet)
- Telegram alert design scoped for trades, errors, IP changes, idle states

## üèóÔ∏è Bot Architecture Overview (Draft)

The bot suite consists of four independent Harmony trading bots, each with:

- **Dedicated wallet** for asset segregation and independent operation
- **Deposit detection** via blockchain event monitoring for relevant assets
- **Strategy execution** according to predefined logic per bot (arbitrage, take profit, dip buying)
- **Trade execution** via SwapRouter02 contract on Harmony (Uniswap V3 fork)
- **Cooldown and state management** to prevent rapid retriggers
- **SQLite local database** per bot recording all trade, deposit, withdrawal data with profit/loss
- **Telegram alert system** for trade confirmations, error notifications, and operational monitoring
- **Off-chain ETH price source** from Coinbase API to compare prices (no trading on Coinbase currently)
- **Gas price & node health monitoring** for optimized transaction costs and reliability
- **Manual withdrawal detection** pausing bot until liquidity replenished

## üìù Notes

- All core smart contract addresses and pool details are documented in `verified_info.md`.
- Detailed bot logic and strategy descriptions are in `README.md`.
- This file is intended to evolve as a live project manager tool.
- Please update task status here regularly to reflect progress and blockers.
