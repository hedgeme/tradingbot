## üèóÔ∏è Bot Architecture Overview (Draft)

All four bots run separately but share common infrastructure:

- **Separate wallets**: one per bot for asset segregation
- **Deposit detection**: monitor blockchain transfers in
- **Strategy execution**: follow logic (arbitrage, take profit, dip buying, pool arbitrage)
- **Swap execution**: SwapRouter02 on Harmony
- **Cooldown timers**: prevent repeated trades too quickly
- **SQLite DB per bot**: logs all deposits, trades, profit/loss, withdrawals
- **Telegram alerts**: updates for trades, errors, manual withdrawals, IP change
- **Gas & node monitoring**: optimize costs, detect downtime
- **Coinbase ETH price**: as off-chain oracle, currently read-only
