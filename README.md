# ðŸ“¦ Harmony Trading Bots - Strategy & Database Overview

This document captures the **full, final design** of four Harmony trading bots, each with its own wallet, strategy, cooldown, reinvestment logic, error handling, and shared SQLite database structure.

It is intended as a living blueprint for development, audit, and future improvements.

## âœ… Overview of the four Harmony bots

### ðŸ§© Bot #1 â€” ETH Price Arbitrage (Harmony vs Coinbase)
| Step | Details |
|----|------|
| Deposit detection | wONE deposit detection (â‰¥â€¯200 wONE required to activate bot). New deposits record new deposit price |
| Price scan | Every 3 minutes, fetch ETH price from Harmony (via ETH/WONE pool) and Coinbase |
| Trigger | If Harmony ETH price is â‰¥â€¯5% lower than Coinbase price |
| Action | Buy ETH with 25% of available wONE |
| Post-trade | Transfer acquired ETH to external wallet `0x360c48a44f513b5781854588d2f1A40E90093c60` |
| Cooldown | Skip trades for 60 minutes after a successful trade |
| Withdraw detection | Manual withdrawal lowers balance; if still â‰¥â€¯200 wONE, continue trading; else pause |

---

### ðŸ§© Bot #2 â€” wONE Take Profit
| Step | Details |
|----|------|
| Deposit detection | wONE deposit detection (â‰¥â€¯200 wONE to activate). New deposits record new deposit price |
| Price scan | Every 3 minutes |
| Trigger | If wONE price rises â‰¥â€¯5% above deposit price |
| Action | Sell 25% of available wONE for 1USDC |
| Post-trade | Send 2% of acquired 1USDC to external wallet |
| Reinvestment | If wONE price drops â‰¥â€¯5% below last sale price, buy wONE with all available 1USDC; send 2% of new wONE to external wallet |
| Cooldown | Trigger again only after new deposit or price change |
| Withdraw detection | If balance drops below 200 wONE, pause; else keep trading |

---

### ðŸ§© Bot #3 â€” USDC Acquisition & Reinvestment
| Step | Details |
|----|------|
| Deposit detection | 1USDC deposit detection (â‰¥â€¯5 1USDC to activate). New deposits record price of ETH & TEC (average across pools) |
| Price scan | Every 3 minutes |
| Trigger | ETH or TEC price drops â‰¥â€¯5% from deposit price |
| Action | Use 25% of available 1USDC to buy the asset with the biggest drop |
| Post-trade | Send 2% of acquired asset to external wallet |
| Reinvestment | If asset price rises â‰¥â€¯5% above last buy price, sell all for 1USDC; send 2% of new 1USDC to external wallet |
| Cooldown | 3 minutes |
| Withdraw detection | If balance drops below 5 1USDC, pause; else keep trading |

---

### ðŸ§© Bot #4 â€” TEC Arbitrage between Pools
| Step | Details |
|----|------|
| Deposit detection | TEC deposit detection (â‰¥â€¯10 TEC to activate). Capture average TEC price across TEC/WONE and TEC/1sDAI pools |
| Price scan | Every 30 minutes |
| Trigger | TEC price difference â‰¥â€¯2% between pools **and** price above deposit price by â‰¥â€¯0.25% |
| Action | Sell 25% of TEC (min 10 TEC) in higher price pool; receive wONE or 1sDAI |
| Post-trade | Send 1% of acquired asset to external wallet |
| Step 2 | Swap remaining acquired asset into other LP |
| Step 3 | Buy TEC back in the lower price pool |
| Reinvestment | After buyback, repeat after 30 min cooldown |
| Withdraw detection | If balance drops below 10 TEC, pause; else keep trading |

## ðŸ›  Shared features & safeguards
| Feature | Details |
|----|----|
| Separate wallets per bot | Keeps liquidity, logic, deposits clean |
| Deposit detection | Detect on-chain incoming txs; every new transfer is captured, records deposit price |
| Withdraw detection | After manual withdrawal, if balance is still above min â†’ keep trading; else pause |
| Cooldown timers | Stored in memory, per bot; avoid spamming trades |
| Gas cap | Read dynamically from RPC (`eth_gasPrice`); max cap at 150 gwei |
| Error handling | Retry failed txs/RPC max 5 times; if still fails, send Telegram alert |
| Telegram reporting | All trades, deposits, withdrawals, errors |
| Reinvestment logic | Dynamic; bots can re-buy or re-sell based on strategy |
| SQLite database | Persistent trade logs for dashboards & audits |
